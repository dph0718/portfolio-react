# Commodore Carousel
A retro-themed photo/link carousel.

## Get started:
You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).
 - `yarn install`,
 - then `yarn start`
 That'll get it running.
 
 The carousel is populated with the array of PortfolioObject objects exported from `/src/data.portfolioObjects.js`.  
 Make some objects and voila!  
 \[ ] I've gotta make it look like it works with less than 8 items in the portfolioObjects array
